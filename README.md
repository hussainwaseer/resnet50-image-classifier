# ResNet50 Image Classifier 🖼️🤖

Welcome to the **ResNet50 Image Classifier** — a simple yet powerful command-line tool to classify images using PyTorch’s pretrained ResNet-50 model!

---

## 🚀 Features

- Classify images with a world-class deep learning model trained on ImageNet  
- Input images from either a **URL** or your **local machine**  
- Automatic image preprocessing (resize, crop, normalize) for optimal results  
- Runs on **CPU** or **GPU** with automatic device detection  
- Interactive and user-friendly CLI interface for seamless usage

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Clone this repository:  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hussainwaseer/resnet50-image-classifier.git
    cd resnet50-image-classifier
    ```

2. Install dependencies:  
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the classifier:  
    ```bash
    python resnet_classifier.py
    ```

4. Follow on-screen prompts to input an image URL or local file path.
